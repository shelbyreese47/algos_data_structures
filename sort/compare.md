### Bubble
Bubble sort works really well with almost sorted data

### Insertion
Insertion sort also works really well with almost sorted data

### Selection
Selection sort does not work well with almost sorted data -- will still look for the lowest item in a loop -- works well if you need data to be continuosly sorted

> Bubble, insertion, and selection are roughly equivalent
> All have average time complexities that are quadratic


## Faster Sorts
Improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
