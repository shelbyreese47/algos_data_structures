// Breadth First Search

    // Create a queue (this can be an array) and a variable to store the vales of nodes visited
    // place the root node in the queue
    // loop as long as there is anything in the queue
    // need a queue and a visited
// **Use this if it isn't a super wide tree-- can use for super long tree (deep tree)


// Depth First Search
    // Traverse down until you hit the end of the tree
    // build an array or list with all values

    // ** use if wide tree - will use less space- fewer nodes to keep track of

// PreOrder
    // explore left side
    // explore right side
    // easier to reconstruct

// InOrder
    //Visit left, node, right
    // Used often for BST's- will get their data back in order

// Post Order
    //vist the left and right before adding the node
    // explore ALL children before the node
