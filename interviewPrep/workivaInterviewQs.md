Tell me about a time you had to handle a conflict on a team.
- Brian gatekeeping knowledge
- 3 day services managers - 1 not pulling weight. We had little oversight and he would try to delegate work to me and the other manager. It was my first time in management so at first I was hesitant to stick up for myself but eventually I got the courage to start telling him 'no that's your job'. It allowed for a better working relationship becuase he respected me more and I didn't continue to harbor negative feelings toward him silently.

What do you think is an ideal team size? 4-6

What are you getting out of this role
- knowledge and growth

What knowledge do you have of object orientated programming?

Difficult problems solved in the past

How do you deal with team members who can't agree on something?
- Come up with a win-win-win solution (lol)
- Parking lot the situation- speak with them individually to see what the issue actually is - bring them back together to discuss a solution

Explain a challenge you had at work and how you overcame it.

Tell me why you are a good fit for this position.

Tell me about a time you led a project.
- I was SCRUM Lead in my final project at General Assembly. It was a great experience and I really enjoyed giving direction and structure to the project. I am naturally very organized and structured, so leading projects is something I very much enjoy. I had 3 developers under me and we each had a role to play. I asked for input on if anyone had preferences and assigned roles from there. There was one person who really wanted back end experience, and the two others were happy either way. I took on back end with one team mate, and the other two devs started on front end. Every morning, we would have a stand up meeting where we would go over the issues we needed to solve that day, along with a few stretch goals for the day. We would touch base before lunch and readjust expectations accordingly. We would also debreif at the end of the day so I could compile our issues for the next day. 

I learned how to be comfortable leading people I highly respect, while allowing for room for their input. We ran into a ton of bugs and problems along the way, which I learned to look at as solvable challenges that were increasing my coding knowledge.

How do you learn complex new systems?
- I like to first learn an overview of the system- then dive into the separate components and how they interact. I believe it is very important to understand how x affects y- almost more important than knowing every detail of every part. When I was working at the nuc plant, a lot of the operators had a bad perception of the engineers because most would write their evaulations and change things at the plant without communicating and checking in with the different departments through out the organization. I believe this was coming from an old school view some of the engineers had- I actually had one engineer tell me ' why would I talk to the outage planners, they do what I say'. After that day, I made sure I did not uphold this tunnel vision that was known throughout the plant. Every evaluation I did, I made sure to bring in ALL of the stakeholders, including maintenance, planners, and operations. I ended up creating so many working relationships that people from separate departments would come to me first to let me know an issue. 

what will be your biggest challenege
- overcoming imposter syndrome!

What would you do if money was no option
- Freelance web/app development while traveling the world!

Weakness
- Tend to take over tasks - my previous manager told me I needed to leave room for others to shine

Strengths 
- Detail oriented 
- Problem solving- this is the reason I got into chemical engineering in the first place. I have a lot of training and skills in this area. I see problems as solvable challenges and remain curious while solving them. This along with my above average patience allows me to slow down and tackle a challenge without getting frustrated. There is always a solution- it might just not be obvious at first. Which, honestly, is what makes it so fun! During my bootcamp, I helped out several other students in solving challenging bugs with their code. I actually recieved the 'quickest to de-bug' award because of this!
